## Depencies

### `Running Locally`

- Clone the master branch from this repo.

- Run `npm Install` to setup your local enviroment

- Run `npm start` to run on  your local machine

### `Future Updates`

- I will like to dispaly the borders of each country by name

- Borders can currently be dispalyed but not as I desired so I commented out the code.
